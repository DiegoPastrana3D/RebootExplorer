# âš RebootExplorerðŸ”§
Script that restarts the 'interface' when needed due to failures such as mouse disappearance, taskbar disappearance, or file explorer failure.

- I recommend saving it in the Documents folder, so that when you need to solve a temporary problem related to explorer.exe, you simply press the Windows key and type RebootExplorer, then press Enter to execute it, avoiding the need to restart the computer for such failures and saving time in the process.

I hope you find it useful :)
